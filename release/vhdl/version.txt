Version: 1.2
Date: April 22nd 2024

This is the functional vhdl release of the block "screen_controller". 
The aim of this bitfile is to test the block "screen_controller"
In order to test it we have "screen_tester" and "top" to deploy it in the PYNQ-Z2.
			   	   
└── top
    ├── screen_tester
    └── screen_controller
        └── spi_master

SW(0) controls the "ON_OFF" of screen_controller.
SW(1) controls the "ENABLE" of screen_tester.

First we activate SW(0) and the "turning_on" sequence in screen_controller is executed.
Once the screen is powered, with SW(1) we enable screen_tester and send the "ENTIRE_DISPLAY_ON_COMMAND".
When we set SW(1) to low, the command "ENTIRE_DISPLAY_OFF_COMMAND" is sent.
When we set SW(0) to low, the "turning_off" sequence is executed by screen_controller.

In the 3 LEDs of the PYNQ we can see useful information (also visible in the port mapping in "top"

SW[1] - ENABLE (screen_tester)
SW[0] - ON_OFF (screen_controller)

LED[3] - Not used
LED[2] - "READY" from screen controller
LED[1] - "ON_OFF_STATUS" bit 1
LED[0] - "ON_OFF_STATUS" bit 0

ON_OFF_STATUS: 00 OFF
			   01 Turning ON
			   10 Turning OFF
			   11 ON

Use:

Open Vivado Hardware manager and load the bitfile into the PYNQ-Z2.

Then you will be able to use it as descibed above

---

Replicate the project:

- Design files: "src/hdl": top, screen_tester, screen_controller and spi_master
- Testbench: "src/tb": top_tb, screen_tester_tb, screen_controller_tb and spi_master_tb
- Constraints : "src/constraints": screen.xdc

It is possible to add an ILA: Run Synthesis and then Open Synthesized Design > Set Up Debug.
All the signals in top will be shown to be aadded to the debug probe, and a new .xdc file will be generated.

Version history:

- 1.0 First functional bitfile
- 1.1 Added ILA
- 1.2 Modified "reset" to "resetn" as AXI IPs use negative reset (not ILA bitfile included)
