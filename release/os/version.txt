Version 3.3
Date June 27th 2024

This is the final stage of the design, the Operating system.

Using Vivado 2022.1 and Vitis 2022.1, we generated the FSBL, the SSBL (U-boot), the device tree and the Linux kernel.
Also generated the same hardware platform from the baremetal.

In the BOOT/ folder we have all of those files:
- BOOT.bin
- devicetree.dtb
- fsbl.elf
- u-boot.elf
- uImage
- screen.xsa
- screen.bit
- extlinux/extlinux.conf

For the Embedded Operating System to work, we need a SD card with two partitions:
- BOOT (100MiB) (FAT32)
- rootfs (remaining space with 100MiB after) (EXT4)

In the BOOT partition we will have:
- BOOT.bin
- devicetree.dtb
- uImage
- extlinux/extlinux.conf

In the rootfs partition we will have the Linaro file system.

We can see all the OS booting process from a serial terminal in our computer (puTTY on Windows or gtkterm on Linux),
as the UART of the PYNQ will be showing a terminal.

When booting up the first time, we will need to execute "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get upgrade".
After that, we will have the ssh-server available and can connect to the PYNQ through SSH (be careful: the IP is be dynamic)
